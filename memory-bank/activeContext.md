# Active Context

This document tracks the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions, important patterns, and project insights.

## Current Work Focus:
Addressing test execution issues and planning for further memory bank enrichment through code review.

## Recent Changes:
- Created the `memory-bank/` directory and core files.
- Initially populated memory bank files based on project documentation (`README.md`, `docs/`).
- Reviewed `adk/agent.py`.
- Completed initial review of key user-facing documentation (`README.md`, `docs/plan/*.md`, `docs/guides/manual_gcp_setup.md`, `docs/tutorials/01-getting-started.md`, `docs/architecture/component_diagram.md`) for consistency with the memory bank.
- Addressed minor inconsistencies found during documentation review (standardised project name in `docs/guides/manual_gcp_setup.md`, clarified deployment methods in `README.md`).
- Reviewed `cli/main.py` and updated `systemPatterns.md` and `techContext.md` with details on the CLI's structure, commands, and use of `subprocess`.
- Executed project tests using `poetry run gen-bootstrap test --coverage`, which failed during collection due to an `ImportError` in `tests/adk/test_agent.py` and showed `PytestUnknownMarkWarning` warnings.
- Modified `tests/adk/test_agent.py` to change the import path for `GoogleSearch` to `google.adk.tools.builtins`.
- Attempted to fix persistent Flake8 linting errors in `tests/adk/test_agent.py`.
- Added `pytest-asyncio` to the development dependencies in `pyproject.toml` to address `@pytest.mark.asyncio` warnings.
- Re-ran tests, which failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'google.adk.tools.builtins'` in `tests/adk/test_agent.py`.
- Reverted the import path for `GoogleSearch` in `tests/adk/test_agent.py` back to `from google.adk.tools import GoogleSearch`.
- Executed `poetry lock` and `poetry install` to update the lock file and install the `pytest-asyncio` dependency.
- Re-ran tests again after reverting the import and installing the dependency. The `ImportError: cannot import name 'GoogleSearch' from 'google.adk.tools'` persists, but the `PytestUnknownMarkWarning` is resolved.
- Made further attempts to fix persistent Flake8 linting errors in `tests/adk/test_agent.py`.
- Successfully updated `adk/agent.py` using `write_to_file` to fix the `ImportError` and update the agent to use the `google_search` function.

## Next Steps:
- Re-run the tests to confirm that the `ImportError` is resolved and the tests pass.
- Based on the test results, continue with deeper code review or focus on writing new tests for uncovered functionality as previously identified.
- Refine and expand the content of all memory bank files based on code review findings.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- Ensuring the memory bank accurately reflects the current state and design decisions of the project.
- Determining the appropriate level of detail for each section in the memory bank files, balancing overview with key implementation specifics.
- Identifying how the code implements the patterns and decisions documented in the ADRs and architecture diagrams.
- Ensuring consistency between user-facing documentation and the memory bank.
- Addressing test failures and warnings to ensure a stable testing environment.

## ADK Summary:
- The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is an open-source Python toolkit for building, evaluating, and deploying AI agents, with a focus on Google Cloud and Gemini integration.
- Key features include a rich tool ecosystem, code-first development, flexible orchestration, context & state management, callbacks for control, deployment readiness, and an evaluation framework.
- Key concepts include Agents, Tools, Callbacks, Sessions, State, Memory, Artifacts, and Events.

## Important Patterns and Preferences:
- Adhering to the defined structure and purpose of each memory bank file.
- Using Markdown for clear and readable documentation.
- Understanding the implementation details of the CLI commands and their interaction with external tools via `subprocess`.
- Maintaining a passing test suite and improving test coverage.

## Learnings and Project Insights:
- The core agent (`root_agent`) is defined in `adk/agent.py` using `google.adk.agents.LlmAgent`.
- The agent's model is configured via `config/settings.py`.
- Tools are provided to the agent during its initialization.
- The agent's instructions are clearly defined within the code.
- The project integrates both a custom tool (`get_current_time_tool`) and a built-in ADK tool (`GoogleSearch`).
- **ADK Architecture and Components:**
    - **Agents:** The fundamental execution units, inheriting from `BaseAgent`. Includes `LlmAgent` for LLM-driven reasoning and `Workflow Agents` for deterministic orchestration.
    - **Tools:** Capabilities provided to agents, including `Function Tools`, `Built-in Tools`, `OpenAPI Tools`, and `Third-Party Tools`.
    - **Callbacks:** Functions that hook into agent lifecycle points for control and customization.
    - **Sessions, State & Memory:** Mechanisms for managing conversational context and long-term knowledge.
    - **Artifacts:** Named, versioned binary data associated with sessions or users.
    - **Runtime & Events:** The execution engine and communication mechanism.
- **FastAPI Integration:**
    - The project uses FastAPI to serve the ADK agent via HTTP, providing standard ADK endpoints and a custom health check. The `get_fast_api_app` function from the ADK is used to create the FastAPI app.
- **Logging and Tracing:**
    - The project integrates Cloud Logging and Trace for observability, using structured logging throughout the project.
- **Documentation Consistency Review Findings:**
    - Overall, user-facing documentation is largely consistent with the memory bank.
    - Minor points for potential refinement include:
        - Use of "sparc" alongside "gen-bootstrap" in `docs/guides/manual_gcp_setup.md`.
        - Potential clarification on `Procfile` vs. `Dockerfile` in `README.md` regarding deployment methods.
        - Differences in focus between the Mermaid diagrams in `detailed_plan.md` (directory structure) and `systemPatterns.md`/`docs/architecture/component_diagram.md` (component interaction) - these are complementary.
- **CLI Implementation Insights (`cli/main.py`):**
    - The CLI uses Typer with subcommands for `tools`, `prompts`, `secrets`, and `monitoring`.
    - Key commands (`init`, `run`, `deploy`, `test`, `setup-gcp`) are implemented in `cli/main.py`.
    - External tools (`gcloud`, `uvicorn`, `adk`, `pytest`) are invoked via `subprocess.run` or `subprocess.Popen`, often prefixed with `poetry run`.
    - The `deploy` command includes pre-deployment test execution (`--run-tests`) and `Procfile` creation logic.
    - The `test` command provides comprehensive pytest and coverage options.
    - The `setup-gcp` command automates API enabling and IAM binding using `gcloud`.
    - Configuration is loaded via `dotenv`.
- **Test Execution Issues:**
    - Initial test run failed due to `ImportError: cannot import name 'GoogleSearch' from 'google.adk.tools'` in `tests/adk/test_agent.py`. An attempt was made to address this by changing the import to `from google.adk.tools.builtins import GoogleSearch`, but this resulted in a `ModuleNotFoundError` on the second test run. The import has been reverted, and the original `ImportError` persists on the third test run.
    - `PytestUnknownMarkWarning` for `@pytest.mark.asyncio` was observed. This was addressed by adding `pytest-asyncio` to development dependencies and running `poetry lock` and `poetry install`. This warning is now resolved.
    - Persistent Flake8 linting errors on specific lines in `tests/adk/test_agent.py` were encountered despite multiple attempts to fix them, suggesting a potential external configuration issue.
    - Further attempts were made to fix the persistent Flake8 linting errors on specific lines in `tests/adk/test_agent.py`.
    - Successfully updated `adk/agent.py` using `write_to_file` to fix the `ImportError` and update the agent to use the `google_search` function.
