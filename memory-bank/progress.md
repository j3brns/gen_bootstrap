# Progress

This document tracks what works, what's left to build, the current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

## What Works:
- Project structure designed for google-adk.
- Core agent logic in `adk/agent.py`.
- Example custom tool in `tools/example_tool.py`.
- Functional CLI with commands: `init`, `run`, `deploy`, `setup-gcp`, `tools list/describe`, `prompts list/get/create`, `secrets list/get/create/add-version`.
- FastAPI server integrated with google-adk and ADK Web UI.
- Basic structured logging and configuration management.
- Example Gradio test client.
- Initial documentation (ADRs, guides, tutorials, plan).
- Successfully updated `adk/agent.py` using `write_to_file` to fix the `ImportError` and update the agent to use the `google_search` function.
- Added tests for `utils/token_utils.py` and updated the code to use the `ttok` command-line tool.

## What's Left to Build:
- Finalizing Cloud Trace integration.
- Completing `gen-bootstrap monitoring dashboard` and `gen-bootstrap monitoring alerts` commands.
- Developing the full Evaluation Framework and `gen-bootstrap evaluate` command.
- Implementing Memory and State Management capabilities.
- Further expanding test coverage.
- Populating the memory bank files with comprehensive details (this is the current task).
- Integrating the ADK into the project.
- Implementing custom tools using the ADK.
- Implementing agents using the ADK.
- Implementing callbacks using the ADK.
- Implementing sessions, state, and memory using the ADK.
- Implementing artifacts using the ADK.
- Implementing evaluation using the ADK.
- Implementing deployment using the ADK.
- Implementing safety and security measures using the ADK.

## Current Status:
The project is actively in the Beta phase, with many core features implemented. Gamma phase development has commenced. Most Alpha phase deliverables are complete.

## Known Issues:
(Based on the provided README, specific known issues are not explicitly stated. I will leave this section open for now.)

## Evolution of Project Decisions:
- Decision to use Poetry for package management (ADR 0001).
- Decision to deploy on Cloud Run (ADR 0002).
- Decision to use Typer/Click for CLI (ADR 0004).
- Decision to use FastAPI/Uvicorn for backend (ADR 0011).
- Decision to set CLI script alias to gen-bootstrap (ADR 0028).
- Decision to use Buildpacks for deployment (ADR 0027).
- Grouping features into phases (ADR 0019).
