# 5. Integrate Cloud Logging and Cloud Trace for Observability

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Operating generative AI applications in production requires visibility into their behavior, performance, and errors. We need a robust system for collecting logs and tracing requests.

## Decision

We will integrate Google Cloud Logging for structured logging and Google Cloud Trace for distributed tracing, leveraging ADK's callback mechanism where appropriate.

## Consequences

*   **Benefits:**
    *   Centralized log collection and analysis in Cloud Logging.
    *   End-to-end request tracing in Cloud Trace to identify bottlenecks.
    *   Logs automatically correlated with traces.
    *   Leverages managed GCP services, reducing operational overhead.
    *   Supports creating log-based metrics for monitoring.
    *   Leverages ADK's callback system for granular logging and tracing of agent behavior.
*   **Drawbacks:**
    *   Requires integrating GCP client libraries into the application code.
    *   Adds some overhead to request processing.
*   **Impact on Plan:**
    *   `utils/` module will include setup and wrapper functions for Cloud Logging and Cloud Trace clients.
    *   Logging will be structured (JSON) for compatibility with Cloud Logging.
    *   Request and response details for model and tool calls will be logged.
    *   Trace and span IDs will be included in log entries.
    *   ADK agents and tools will use the logging utilities, and ADK's callback mechanism will be used to log details of agent lifecycle events, model interactions, and tool executions.
    *   Cloud Run service identity requires IAM permissions for Logging and Trace.
    *   Monitoring plan relies on Cloud Logging and Trace data.
    *   Optional Weave integration complements this by providing alternative visualization.
