# 1. Use Poetry for Package Management

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Managing Python project dependencies, virtual environments, and packaging can be complex. We need a robust and modern tool that provides reproducible builds and simplifies dependency management for both development and production environments.

## Decision

We will use Poetry as the primary package manager for this project.

## Consequences

*   **Benefits:**
    *   Reproducible builds via `poetry.lock`.
    *   Simplified dependency management (`poetry add`, `poetry remove`).
    *   Integrated virtual environment management.
    *   Clean project structure with `pyproject.toml`.
    *   Easy separation of main and development dependencies.
    *   Streamlined packaging for distribution or containerization.
*   **Drawbacks:**
    *   Requires users to install Poetry.
    *   Might be unfamiliar to users accustomed to `pip` and `requirements.txt`.
*   **Impact on Plan:**
    *   `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` will be core project files.
    *   CLI `init` command will guide users to install Poetry and run `poetry install`.
    *   Dockerfile will include steps to install Poetry and install dependencies using `poetry install --no-dev`.
    *   Documentation will cover Poetry usage.
