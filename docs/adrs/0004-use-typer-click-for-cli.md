# 4. Use Typer/Click for the CLI

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to build a command-line interface (CLI) for managing the generative AI ADK project lifecycle. The CLI should be user-friendly, easy to develop, and provide features like argument parsing, help messages, and command structuring.

## Decision

We will use Typer, which is built on Click, as the framework for developing the project's CLI.

## Consequences

*   **Benefits:**
    *   Simplifies the creation of command-line applications in Python.
    *   Automatic generation of help messages and usage information.
    *   Robust argument and option parsing.
    *   Supports nested commands for better organization.
    *   Typer adds type hinting support, improving code clarity and maintainability.
    *   Large and active community support (Click).
*   **Drawbacks:**
    *   Adds a dependency to the project.
    *   Requires developers to learn the Typer/Click syntax.
*   **Impact on Plan:**
    *   The `cli/` directory will contain Python code structured using Typer/Click decorators and functions.
    *   Typer/Click will be listed as a core dependency in `pyproject.toml`.
    *   CLI commands outlined in the plan will be implemented using this framework.
