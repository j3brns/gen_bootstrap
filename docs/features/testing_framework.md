# Feature: Testing Framework Integration

## Status

Planned (Alpha Phase - Basic, Beta Phase - Enhanced)

## Description

This feature integrates a testing framework and related tools to enable writing and running automated tests for the project's code, ensuring correctness and maintainability.

## Goals

*   Provide a clear structure for organizing tests (unit and integration).
*   Enable easy execution of tests via the CLI.
*   Facilitate isolating code under test using mocking.
*   Enforce code quality standards using automated checks before commits.

## Components

*   **pytest:** The primary testing framework.
*   **pytest-mock:** Plugin for mocking external dependencies in pytest tests.
*   **unittest.mock:** Python's built-in mocking library (used by pytest-mock).
*   **`tests/` Directory:** Houses all project tests, organized into `unit/` and `integration/`.
*   **`tests/data/`:** (Optional) Directory for test data.
*   **`cli/commands/test.py`:** Implements the `cli test` command to run tests.
*   **`pre-commit`:** Framework for managing pre-commit hooks.
*   **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`:** Configuration file for pre-commit hooks.
*   **Linters/Formatters:** `black`, `isort`, `flake8` (used via pre-commit).
*   **`nbstripout`:** Pre-commit hook for cleaning notebook outputs.

## Implementation Details

*   Include `pytest`, `pytest-mock`, `pre-commit`, and linters/formatters as development dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.
*   Structure tests within the `tests/` directory following pytest conventions.
*   Implement the `cli test` command to run `pytest`.
*   Configure `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with hooks for formatting, linting, and notebook output stripping.
*   Use the `mocker` fixture from `pytest-mock` to mock external dependencies in tests (GCP calls, tool executions, etc.).
*   Document how to write and run tests, use mocking, and set up pre-commit hooks.
*   (Gamma Phase) Integrate test execution into the `cli deploy` command as an optional pre-deployment check.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Users can run all project tests using the `cli test` command.
*   Unit tests effectively verify individual components in isolation using mocking.
*   Integration tests verify interactions between components.
*   Running `pre-commit install` sets up the git hooks correctly.
*   Committing code triggers the pre-commit hooks (formatting, linting, etc.).
*   Code formatting and style are consistently applied by pre-commit hooks.
*   Notebook outputs are automatically removed before committing.
*   Documentation explains how to contribute tests and maintain code quality.
