# Feature: Logging and Tracing Integration

## Status

Planned (Beta Phase)

## Description

This feature integrates Google Cloud Logging and Google Cloud Trace to provide comprehensive observability into the execution of ADK agents and the overall application.

## Goals

*   Collect structured application logs in Cloud Logging.
*   Provide end-to-end request tracing in Cloud Trace.
*   Correlate log entries with specific traces and spans.
*   Log details of interactions with generative models and external tools (requests and responses).
*   Facilitate debugging and performance analysis.

## Components

*   **Google Cloud Logging:** The GCP service for centralized log collection.
*   **Google Cloud Trace:** The GCP service for distributed tracing.
*   **`utils/logging_utils.py`:** Python module for configuring structured logging and integrating with Cloud Logging.
*   **`utils/tracing_utils.py`:** Python module for integrating with Cloud Trace and creating spans.
*   **`utils/model_utils.py` (or similar):** Wrapper functions for model interaction that include logging of requests/responses.
*   **`tools/`:** Tool implementations that use logging utilities.
*   **ADK Agents (`adk/`):** Agent code that uses logging and benefits from tracing.
*   **Cloud Run:** Automatically collects logs from standard output/error and sends them to Cloud Logging.
*   **IAM Permissions:** Required for the Cloud Run service identity to write logs and send traces.
*   **Optional Weave Integration:** Provides an alternative visualization layer.

## Implementation Details

*   Configure Python's `logging` to output structured logs (JSON).
*   Use the `google-cloud-logging` and `google-cloud-trace` Python client libraries.
*   Implement log correlation with trace and span IDs.
*   Wrap model and tool calls to automatically log request and response details.
*   Create spans for key operations within the agent execution flow.
*   Document how to view logs in Cloud Logging and traces in Cloud Trace.
*   Document necessary IAM permissions.
*   Implement conditional logging to Weave if enabled (Gamma Phase).

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Application logs appear in Cloud Logging in a structured format.
*   Log entries for a single request are correlated with a trace ID.
*   Traces for requests are visible in Cloud Trace.
*   Details of model requests and responses are logged.
*   Details of tool calls and results are logged.
*   Errors are logged with appropriate severity levels.
*   (Optional) Logs and traces appear in Weave when enabled.
