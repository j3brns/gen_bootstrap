# Feature: Monitoring and Alerting

## Status

Planned (Gamma Phase)

## Description

This feature provides capabilities for monitoring the health and performance of the deployed application using Google Cloud Monitoring and setting up alerts using Google Cloud Alerting.

## Goals

*   Visualize key application and infrastructure metrics.
*   Receive notifications when predefined thresholds are breached.
*   Facilitate identifying and responding to production issues.
*   Leverage built-in Cloud Run metrics and log-based metrics.

## Components

*   **Google Cloud Monitoring:** The GCP service for collecting and visualizing metrics.
*   **Google Cloud Alerting:** The GCP service for defining alerting policies and notification channels.
*   **Cloud Run Metrics:** Built-in metrics provided by Cloud Run (request count, latency, error rate, resource utilization).
*   **Cloud Logging:** Source of data for creating custom log-based metrics.
*   **`cli/commands/monitoring.py`:** Implements CLI commands (`cli monitoring setup`, `dashboard`, `alerts`) to configure monitoring resources.
*   **Google Cloud Monitoring API / `gcloud`:** Used by the CLI to interact with Cloud Monitoring.
*   **IAM Permissions:** Required for the Cloud Run service identity and the user running the setup command.

## Implementation Details

*   Leverage built-in Cloud Run metrics automatically available in Cloud Monitoring.
*   Guide users on creating custom log-based metrics in Cloud Monitoring based on application logs sent to Cloud Logging.
*   Implement the `cli monitoring setup` command to automate the creation of a basic Cloud Monitoring dashboard and alerting policies (e.g., based on error rate, latency).
*   The setup command will use `gcloud` commands or the Google Cloud Monitoring API.
*   Document the types of metrics available, how to create log-based metrics, how to use the CLI setup command, and how to configure notification channels in Cloud Alerting.
*   Document necessary IAM permissions for monitoring setup and data access.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Users can use the CLI to set up a basic Cloud Monitoring dashboard for their Cloud Run service.
*   The dashboard displays key metrics like request count, latency, and error rate.
*   Users can use the CLI to set up basic alerting policies (e.g., for high error rate).
*   Alerts are triggered and notifications are sent when the defined conditions are met.
*   Documentation clearly explains how to set up and use monitoring and alerting.
*   Documentation guides users on creating custom log-based metrics.
