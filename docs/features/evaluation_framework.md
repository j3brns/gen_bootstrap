# Feature: Evaluation Framework

## Status

Planned (Gamma Phase)

## Description

This feature provides a structured framework for evaluating the performance and quality of generative AI agents against predefined datasets and metrics.

## Goals

*   Enable systematic evaluation of agent performance.
*   Support running agents against consistent test datasets.
*   Facilitate measuring and comparing metrics across different agent versions, models, or configurations.
*   Provide a CLI command to trigger evaluation runs.
*   Integrate with logging and optional Weave for recording and visualizing evaluation results.

## Components

*   **`evaluation/` Directory:** Houses evaluation-related files.
*   **`evaluation/configs/`:** Stores configuration files for evaluation runs.
*   **`evaluation/datasets/`:** Stores test datasets or scripts to access them.
*   **`evaluation/scripts/`:** Contains Python scripts for executing evaluation logic.
*   **`evaluation/results/`:** (Often excluded from version control) Stores evaluation output and reports.
*   **`cli/commands/evaluate.py`:** Implements the `cli evaluate` command.
*   **ADK Agents (`adk/`):** The agents being evaluated.
*   **Logging and Tracing:** Used to record details of evaluation runs.
*   **Optional Weave Integration:** For enhanced visualization and tracking of evaluation results.

## Implementation Details

*   Define a structure for evaluation configuration files (e.g., YAML).
*   Implement the `cli evaluate` command to read configurations and execute evaluation scripts.
*   Develop example evaluation scripts that load datasets, run agents, and calculate metrics.
*   Ensure evaluation scripts use the logging utilities (and optionally Weave) to record run details, inputs, outputs, and metrics.
*   Document how to set up evaluation configurations, create datasets, write evaluation scripts, and run evaluations using the CLI.
*   Document how to interpret evaluation results in logs, Cloud Monitoring (if metrics are emitted), and optionally Weave.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Users can define an evaluation run using a configuration file.
*   Users can trigger an evaluation run using the `cli evaluate` command.
*   The evaluation script successfully runs the specified agent against the dataset.
*   Relevant metrics are calculated and logged for each evaluation run.
*   Evaluation results are saved to the `evaluation/results/` directory (or configured location).
*   Evaluation runs and their results are visible in Cloud Logging (and optionally Weave).
*   Documentation clearly explains how to use the evaluation framework.
