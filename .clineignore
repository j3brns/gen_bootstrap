# data/*.csv

# Exclude documentation directories if not needed for code context
# docs/

# Exclude example files or scripts
# examples/

# Exclude specific test files or directories if focusing on production code
# tests/

# Exclude files with specific extensions
# *.log
# *.tmp

# Exclude the .clineignore file itself
.clineignore
